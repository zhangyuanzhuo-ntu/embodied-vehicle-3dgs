This project optimizes the MonoGS 3DGS-based monocular SLAM system for accurate localization and environment perception. A deep reinforcement learning controller enables emergency obstacle avoidance and precise parking. Deployed on the Zotac RK3588, NPU acceleration improves real-time performance on edge platforms.
